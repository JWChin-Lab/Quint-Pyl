This is the software used to cluster PylRS and tRNAPyl sequences and identify sets of mutually orthogonal PylRS/tRNAPyl pairs. 

This software was developed by Adam Beattie, Daniel Dunkelmann and Jason Chin at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology.

This software is free software, licensed under the GNU GPL license v3.0.


SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
 
Python 3.9.7
Full package information is listed in the jupyter notebook "PylRST_Analysis_Code_v2.ipynb".

The software was tested on a Mac computer running macOS 12.
Installation: install Python 3.9.7 and the listed packages.
Install time: a few minutes.


HOW TO USE

A full demo is provided which contains the PylRS ("All-PylRS-Description-Table-MSA.csv") and tRNAPyl ("PylT_A_B_manual_aligned.txt" for previously characterised tRNAs, "PID55-Repr-PylTs-manual-align.fasta" for representative tRNAs from all PylRS clusters) data for clustering, as well as GFP expression data ("Fig4_allscreendata_with_evol.csv") for identification of mutually orthogonal sets.
To run the demo, open the jupyter notebook file ("PylRST_Analysis_Code_v2.ipynb") and run each cell.

The runtime should be a few minutes on a normal desktop computer. The workbook has already been pre-run and therefore examples of the desired outputs (both within the workbook and as the separate clustergram figure files) are already present.
